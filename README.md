## 🧮 Maths Quiz – Times Tables (Python)
Overview
This is a simple, interactive times tables quiz written in Python.
Each question randomly picks two integers between 1 and 20, asks the user to compute their product, validates the input, and keeps prompting until the correct answer is given. The program can be configured to ask a fixed number of questions in a session.
### Key features
Random multiplication questions (1–20)
Input validation (rejects non‑numeric answers gracefully)
“Try again” loop until the user gets it right
Configurable number of questions per run
